# pywisetransfer

An unofficial, experimental Python client library for the [TransferWise API](https://api-docs.transferwise.com).

:warning: The classes, functions and interfaces that this library provides are very much in-development and prone to change.

## Installation

```bash
# Within your project directory
pip install pywisetransfer
```
After installation, you should be able to import the package.

```python
>>> from pywisetransfer import Client

```

## Usage

Wise provides [two APIs](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference#environments): `live` and `sandbox`.
You can use either of these environments with this library.

### API Key

In order to use the API, you need to obtain an API key.
This key looks like this: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abcde`

To use the sandbox API, log into [sandbox.transferwise.tech].
Then, go to Settings ðŸ š Developer Tools ðŸ š API-Tokens.
Create and copy a new API key.

To use your own account, log into [wise.com](https://wise.com).
Then click on your account at the top right ðŸ š Integrations and Tools ðŸ š Developer Tools ðŸ š API Tokens and add a new token.

[sandbox.transferwise.tech]: https://sandbox.transferwise.tech

### API Requests

The API requests are made using the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
First of all, you create a `Client` object:

- Create a `Client` object with your API key for the `live` environment:

    ```python
    >>> client = Client(api_key="your-api-key-here", environment="live")

    ```

- Create a `Client` object with your API key for the `sandbox` environment:

    ```python
    >>> client = Client(api_key="your-api-key-here")

    ```

- Create a `Client` object which interacts with the recorded API which is used for the tests:

    ```python
    >>> from pywisetransfer.test import TestClient
    >>> client = TestClient()

    ```

    After this, all calls to the real Wise API are blocked by the `responses` library.
    To stop using the recorded API:

    ```python
    client.stop()
    ```

## Examples

This section provides a few examples of how to use this package.

### Profiles

This library follows the **[Wise API Reference]**.
So, if you find e.g. profile here, you can look up all the values of it in the [Wise API Reference].

If you create a sandbox account, you should have two profiles: `business` and `personal`.

```python
>>> for profile in client.profiles.list():
...     print(f"id: {profile.id}")
...     print(f"type: {profile.type}")
...     print(f"name: {profile.details.name}")
... 
id: 28577318
type: personal
name: Teresa Adams
id: 28577319
type: business
name: Law and Daughters 6423

```

### Receive Money

One profile can have several accounts in different currencies.
This shows which currencies are accepted and how to receive money.

```python
>>> for profile in client.profiles.list():
...     accounts = client.account_details.list(profile_id=profile.id)
...     print(f"type: {profile.type}")
...     for account in accounts:
...         print(
...             f"    currency: {account.currency.code}"
...             f" receive with: {', '.join(feature.title for feature in account.bankFeatures if feature.supported)}")
... 
type: personal
    currency: EUR receive with: Receive locally, Receive internationally (Swift), Set up Direct Debits, Receive from PayPal and Stripe
    currency: GBP receive with: Receive locally, Receive internationally (Swift), Set up Direct Debits, Receive from PayPal and Stripe
    currency: USD receive with: Receive locally, Receive internationally (Swift), Set up Direct Debits, Receive from PayPal and Stripe
    currency: AUD receive with: Receive locally, Set up Direct Debits
    currency: NZD receive with: Receive locally
    currency: CAD receive with: Receive locally, Set up Direct Debits
    currency: HUF receive with: Receive locally
    currency: MYR receive with:

    currency: USD receive with: Receive locally, Receive internationally (Swift), Set up Direct Debits, Receive from PayPal and Stripe
    currency: AUD receive with: Receive locally, Set up Direct Debits

    currency: TRY receive with: Receive locally

```

### Balance

This code retrieves the balance for each currency in each account.

```python
>>> profiles = client.profiles.list()
>>> for profile in profiles:
...     print(f"type: {profile.type} {', '.join(f'{balance.totalWorth.value}{balance.totalWorth.currency}' for balance in client.balances.list(profile=profile))}")
... 
type: personal 1000000.0GBP, 1000000.0EUR, 1000000.0USD, 1000000.0AUD
type: business 1000000.0GBP, 1000000.0EUR, 1000000.0USD, 1000000.0AUD

```

### Currencies

Wise supports many [currencies](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference/currencies).

```python
>>> currencies = client.currencies.list()
>>> AED = currencies[0]
>>> AED.code
'AED'
>>> AED.name
'United Arab Emirates dirham'
>>> AED.symbol
'Ø¯.Ø¥'

```

Above are the up-to-date currencies.
You can also use those in the package.

```python
>>> from pywisetransfer import Currency
>>> Currency.AED.code
'AED'
>>> Currency.AED.name
'United Arab Emirates dirham'
>>> Currency.AED.symbol
'Ø¯.Ø¥'

```

### Recipient Account Requirements

In this example, we get the requirements for a recipient account that should receive 100 GBP from us.

```python
>>> requirements = client.recipient_accounts.get_requirements_for_currency(source=Currency.GBP, target=Currency.GBP, source_amount=100)
>>> list(sorted([requirement.type for requirement in requirements]))
[email, iban, sort_code]

```

### Webhook signature verification

```python
from flask import abort, request
from pywisetransfer.webhooks import validate_request

@app.route("/payments/wise/webhooks")
def handle_wise_webhook():
    try:
        validate_request(request)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Wise webhook request validation failed: {e}")
        abort(400)

    ...
```

### Request an Example Quote

You can request quote examples as stated in [Create an un-authenticated quote](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference/quote#create-not-authenticated).

In this example, we want to transfer `GBP` to `USD` and make sure we have `110USD` in the end.
The example quote requires less information than a real quote.

```python
>>> from pywisetransfer import ExampleQuoteRequest
>>> quote_request = ExampleQuoteRequest(
...     sourceCurrency="GBP",
...     targetCurrency="USD",
...     sourceAmount=None,
...     targetAmount=110,
... )
>>> example_quote = client.quotes.example(quote_request)
>>> example_quote.rate
1.25155
>>> example_quote.rateExpirationTime
datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 19, 21, 44, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
>>> example_quote.profile == None  # Example quotes are not bound to a profile
True
>>> example_quote.rateType
FIXED

```

### Create a Recipient of a Transfer

### Request a Quote

To create a transfer, you first need a quote.
You can read on how to create [Create an authenticated quote](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference/quote#create-authenticated).

In this example, we create a quote for the personal account. This is the same quote as the one above.
We also provide pay-out and pay-in information.
The `targetAccount` is None because we don't know the recipient yet.

```python
>>> from pywisetransfer import QuoteRequest, PaymentMethod
>>> quote_request = QuoteRequest(
...        sourceCurrency="GBP",
...        targetCurrency="USD",
...        sourceAmount=None,
...        targetAmount=110,
...        targetAccount=None,
...        payOut=PaymentMethod.BANK_TRANSFER,
...        preferredPayIn=PaymentMethod.BANK_TRANSFER,
...    )
>>> quote = client.quotes.create(quote_request, profile=profiles.personal[0])
>>> quote.user
12970746
>>> quote.status
PENDING
>>> quote.sourceCurrency
'GBP'
>>> quote.targetCurrency 
'USD'
>>> quote.sourceAmount is None  # the source amount depends on the payment option
True
>>> quote.targetAmount
110.0
>>> quote.rate
1.24232
>>> quote.rateType
FIXED
>>> quote.payOut
BANK_TRANSFER
>>> len(quote.paymentOptions)  # we have many payment options
20

```

## Run tests

```bash
# Within the pywisetransfer working directory
pip install .[dev]
